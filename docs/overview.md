# 🧬 PQ-Core: Protocol Overview

## What is PQ-Core?

**PQ-Core** is a cryptographic protocol stack built from the ground up to provide **post-quantum secure communication**. not aiming as a wrapper around someone else’s library—it’s the core of a new generation of communication, **engineered to resist quantum-era threats**(hopefully) and empower decentralized, surveillance-free interaction.

Where most libraries stop at raw crypto primitives, PQ-Core goes further: it outlines an entire protocol designed to enable **peer-to-peer encrypted messaging, identity verification, and forward secrecy**—all without ever trusting a central authority.

Think of it as the **Tor of cryptography stacks**: paranoid, elegant, modular, and unapologetically private.

(I know its too high to aim, for now.)
## Why Does PQ-Core Exist?

Quantum computing is no longer sci-fi. With Shor’s algorithm looming over RSA and ECC like a guillotine, most of the world’s current encryption is on borrowed time. Messaging apps, dating platforms, political whistleblower tools—all are vulnerable to:

- **Harvest Now, Decrypt Later** attacks
- **Metadata analysis and central server correlation**
- **Backdoored or outdated cryptographic libraries**
- **Surveillance of centralized matchmaking servers**

PQ-Core exists because modern security is fundamentally flawed in the face of this new paradigm.

We're not here to tweak the status quo. We're here to burn it down and rebuild it.

## Core Design Goals

1. 🔐 **Quantum-Resilient Key Exchange**
   - Implemented using **lattice-based cryptography** (Kyber-like).
   - Resistant to both classical and quantum decryption.

2. ✍️ **Post-Quantum Digital Signatures**
   - Based on **Dilithium-style** signature schemes.
   - Designed for identity attestation and message authenticity.

3. 📡 **Message Encryption**
   - Uses symmetric encryption (AES or custom lattice symmetrics) over keys negotiated via PQ methods.
   - All messages are wrapped in onion-style layers for minimal leakage.

4. 🛠️ **Modularity**
   - Components are plug-and-play. Want to swap Kyber for NTRU later? Easy.
   - Perfect for layering on top of mesh networks, P2P backends, or anonymized transport.

5. 🌐 **Integration-Ready**
   - Future-ready for embedding into apps, especially decentralized systems like:
     - Secure dating/messaging platforms
     - Anti-censorship communication tools
     - Anonymous identity networks

6. 🧱 **Built from Scratch**
   - No black-box crypto.
   - All mathematics and logic auditable, understandable, and free from hidden assumptions.

## How Does PQ-Core Work?

At a high level, PQ-Core performs the following sequence between two peers—**Alice** and **Bob** (Sorry if these are *your* names):

1. **Key Generation**
   - Both Alice and Bob generate their own public-private lattice key pairs.
   - Keys are ephemeral or persistent depending on the application.

2. **Key Exchange via Encapsulation**
   - Bob sends Alice a Kyber-style encapsulated key.
   - Alice decapsulates to derive the shared secret.
   - Both parties now have a mutual secret.

3. **Signature Exchange (Optional)**
   - Alice signs her ephemeral public key using a Dilithium-style signature.
   - Bob verifies her identity if needed (for semi-trusted or persistent IDs).

4. **Secure Channel Creation**
   - A symmetric encryption session (e.g., AES-256) is established using the derived key.
   - Messages are exchanged via this encrypted channel.

5. **Metadata-Hardened Communication**
   - Messages are time-padded and uniformly sized to prevent traffic analysis.
   - No persistent identifiers are revealed in any layer of the protocol.

## Who Is PQ-Core For?

- **Developers** building decentralized or secure-by-design applications.
- **Researchers** looking for customizable post-quantum implementations to experiment with.
- **Cryptography students** who want to learn lattice-based crypto from a hands-on, readable codebase.
- **Paranoid visionaries** who don’t trust Silicon Valley or GCHQ and want something they can audit line by line.

## What PQ-Core Is NOT

- ❌ A polished drop-in library with high-level APIs—yet.
- ❌ A toy implementation just meant for education.
- ❌ A centralized or cloud-dependent toolkit.

PQ-Core is bare-bones in the best way. If you're looking for batteries-included, wait until the app integration phase. This repo is the forge, not the storefront.

## The Long-Term Vision

PQ-Core is the **first layer** of a much larger system. In future phases, we’ll be developing:

- 💞 A **decentralized dating app** using PQ-Core for message exchange.
- 🌐 **Tor-integration** to anonymize traffic paths.
- 🧠 **ZK-proof compatibility** for identity without exposure.
- 📱 **Mobile-friendly FFI bindings** (Rust/C++ → Swift/Kotlin)

This isn't a closed loop—it's the beginning of a stack.

## Final Words

> _“The day before the quantum computer is built is the last day your secrets are safe.”_  
> — Some wise bastard with a sense of timing.

PQ-Core is our answer to a world that's already watching, already listening, and already storing. It’s time to build systems that assume surveillance—and destroy its usefulness.

Welcome to the future of cryptographic communication.
