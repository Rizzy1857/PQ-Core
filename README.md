# PQ-Core 🔒 [![Rust](https://img.shields.io/badge/Rust-1.70+-blue.svg)](https://www.rust-lang.org/)

**An implementation of post-quantum secure communication protocols**

## ⚠️ Project Status

Experimental - Under active development. Not yet suitable for production use. (or any use for that matter)

## 🚀 Features

- **Pure-Rust cryptographic primitives**
  - Lattice-based KEM (Kyber512)
  - Lattice-based signatures (Dilithium-style)
  - NTT-accelerated polynomial arithmetic
- **Zero-dependency core** (except randomness/security libs)
- **Memory-safe by design**
  - Zeroization of secrets
  - Constant-time operations where critical
- **Testable/auditable architecture**

## 🚧 Project Archived

This project is currently archived as I do not have the necessary skills or bandwidth to continue its development or maintenance.

If you're interested in forking or reviving it, feel free to do so. Contributions or improvements are always welcome elsewhere.
